      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
        \item {\fontsize{10pt}{1em}\bodyfont\bfseries\color{darktext}Simulation Modeling ToolKit and Computational Model Builder framework}
          \begin{itemize}
              \item {Architected a reactor modeling tool kit which provideded a front end UI to design and visualize complicated model via Qt and GPU glyphing, adding C++ python binding support and ability to launch parallel meshing jobs with Cubit}
              \item {Created a meteorological geo-data browser which allow users to fetch data asynchronizally from remote servers and analyze them on real world map via OpenStreetMap RESTful API and MVVM design pattern}
              \item {Implemented data I\/O serialization via nlohmann\_json and several geometry deformation algorithms such as terrain extraction, bathemetry, etc}
              \item {Created a singleton model manager which bridged the modeling server and visualization client\\}
          \end{itemize}
        \item {\fontsize{10pt}{1em}\bodyfont\bfseries\color{darktext}Scientific visualization algorithms for Massively Threaded Architectures toolkit(VTK-m)}
          \begin{itemize}
              \item {Implemented a bunch of parallel scientific algorithms(split shape edge, probe, etc) and improved the shared memory support for CUDA and runtime selection for TBB and OpenMP}
              \item {Simplified the testing infrastructure which is capable of parsing runtime arguments and saving runtime overheads by CRTP pattern and generic programming. It reduced the binary size by 80\% and improved 40\% of runtime performance}
              \item {Refactored the code base with C++11 features which simplified meta programming, improving runtime overhead as well as adding a reliable random number generation and prepare for C++14 migration}
               % thread_local
              \item {Added an address sanitizer nightly build which automatically reported memory errors to a remote dashboard\\}
          \end{itemize}
        \item {\fontsize{10pt}{1em}\bodyfont\bfseries\color{darktext}Adaptable Input Output System Version 2(ADIOS2)}
          \begin{itemize}
              \item {Implemented a parallel data reader which could distribute and balance loads among many processes and visualize streaming data, in-situ data in large scale}
              \item {Parallelized the engine tests(BP, HDF5, ADIOS1, etc) and binding tests(Python, Fortran)}
              \item {Extended FindGoogleTesting CMake module so that it can launch MPI tests and provide a better CMake integration}
          \end{itemize}
